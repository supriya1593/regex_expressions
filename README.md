Data Collection and Email Sender
This project collects data from a CSV file containing names, email addresses, and messages, and then sends personalized emails to the recipients using Python's smtplib library. The emails are sent through an SMTP server (such as Gmail's).

Prerequisites
Python 3.x

SMTP access (such as Gmail)

A CSV file containing the email addresses and messages you want to send

Installation:
Clone this repository or download the Python script.

bash
Copy
git clone <repository-url>
Install the required Python packages (if needed). For this project, only built-in libraries like csv and smtplib are used, so no external installations are required.

Update the script with your email credentials:

Replace your_email@gmail.com with your own email address.

Replace your_email_password with your email password or app-specific password (for Gmail, you can create an app-specific password from your Google account settings).

Note: For Gmail, you may need to enable "Less secure apps" or use an App Password if you have 2-step verification enabled.

CSV File Format
Create a CSV file with the following columns:

name: The recipient's name.

email: The recipient's email address.

message: The personalized message you want to send.

Example contacts.csv:
csv
Copy
name,email,message
John,john@example.com,Hello John!
Alice,alice@example.com,Hi Alice!
Script Overview
1. Data Collection
The script reads the contacts.csv file and extracts the name, email, and message for each entry.

python
Copy
def collect_data_from_csv(file_path):
    data = []
    with open(file_path, mode='r') as file:
        csv_reader = csv.reader(file)
        next(csv_reader)  # Skip the header
        for row in csv_reader:
            name, email, message = row
            data.append({'name': name, 'email': email, 'message': message})
    return data
2. Sending Emails
Using Python's smtplib library, the script sends personalized emails to each recipient. The email body is customized based on the recipient's name and message from the CSV.

python
Copy
def send_email(sender_email, sender_password, recipient_email, subject, body):
    try:
        server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)  # Use Gmail SMTP server
        server.starttls()
        server.login(sender_email, sender_password)

        msg = MIMEMultipart()
        msg['From'] = sender_email
        msg['To'] = recipient_email
        msg['Subject'] = subject
        msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))

        text = msg.as_string()
        server.sendmail(sender_email, recipient_email, text)
        print(f"Email sent to {recipient_email}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to send email to {recipient_email}. Error: {str(e)}")
    finally:
        server.quit()
3. Putting it All Together
The script collects data from the CSV file and sends the emails to the recipie"

# Collect data from the CSV file
data = collect_data_from_csv('contacts.csv')

# Send personalized emails
for entry in data:
    body = f"Hello {entry['name']},\n\n{entry['message']}\n\nBest regards."
    send_email(sender_email, sender_password, entry['email'], subject, body)
Running the Script
Make sure your CSV file (contacts.csv) is in the same directory as the Python script or update the path accordingly.

Update the script with your email credentials.

Run the script:

bash
Copy
python send_emails.py
The script will read the data from the CSV file and send personalized emails to each contact.
